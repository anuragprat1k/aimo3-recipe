AIMO3 Recipe: Post-training LLMs for Mathematical Reasoning

This package provides training recipes for fine-tuning LLMs on MATH datasets,
specifically targeting the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) Progress Prize 3.

Key components:
- data: Dataset loading and preprocessing for math problems
- training: SFT and RL training loops with Chain-of-Thought and TIR
- evaluation: Benchmarking on MATH, AMC, AIME, and olympiad problems
- inference: Generation with self-consistency and tool integration
